# âš¡ Quickstart

## ðŸ’¾Installation

To install Larawiz, just fire up Composer in your project root folder and require it in your development dependencies.

```bash
composer require -dev larawiz/larawiz 
```

## ðŸ“˜ Usage

To start using Larawiz, just publish the sample Database and HTTP scaffold files using the `larawiz:sample` command and you're done. These files are meant to be self-explanatory.

```bash
php artisan larawiz:sample

# Larawiz v1.0
#
# Scaffold sample files published. Happy coding!
#
# * var/www/app/larawiz/database.yml
#
# Once you're done, use `larakick:scaffold` to create your proyect.
```

The above will publish files for a sample blog site so you can tinker around immediately. Once you're done, simply scaffold your project.

```bash
php artisan larawiz:scaffold

# Larawiz v1.0
#
# Scaffodling your proyect, it will take a little time.
```

Of course, this will work for simple applications. Larawiz will try to guess almost everything. This documentation will help you do some less-simple things.

## ðŸ“‚ Backups

Larawiz will automatically copy your `app` and some of your `database` directories as backups every time you scaffold.

You can find it in your application default storage path under the `storage/larakick/backups` directory, and copy them over your project if you need to go back to a previous state.
