# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Larawiz

Larawiz is a project scaffolder with noob-friendly syntax, intelligent and flexible.

With Larawiz you will **never touch an artisan command again**.

## What Larawiz solves?

Larawiz, short for "**Lara**vel **Wiz**ard", is a scaffolder. From a simple YAML, Larawiz will spawn multiple files with synchronized properties and attributes. This is a great alternative to creating each file from scratch or from the command line.

Larawiz works out of the box, it was created to think less and do more, and comes with sample files to create simple Blog.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="YAML" %}
```yaml
models:
  User:
    name: string
    email: string
    email_verified_at: timestamp nullable
    password: string
    is_admin: boolean default:false
    rememberToken: ~
    comments: hasMany:Comment
    posts: hasMany:Post

  Post:
    uuid: ~
    title: string
    body: longText
    author: belongsTo:User
    comments: hasMany:Comment

  Comment:
    body: string
    author: belongsTo:User
    post: belongsTo:Post
    softDeletes: ~

migrations:
  failed_jobs:
    id: ~
    connection: text
    queue: text
    payload: longText
    exception: longText
    failed_at: timestamp useCurrent
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

From that file, here is what is created:

* `User`, `Post` and `Comment` [models](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent#defining-models), complete with: PHPDocs, [primary keys](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions), [timestamps](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions), [attribute casting](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting), [relations](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent-relationships) and [fillable properties](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent#mass-assignment).
* [Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/migrations#introduction) for `users`,  `posts` and `comments` tables.
* `UserFactory`, `PostFactory` and `CommentFactory` [factories](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/database-testing#writing-factories).
* `UsersSeeder`, `PostsSeeder` and `CommentsSeeder` [seeders](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/seeding).
* The `PostPolicy` and `CommentPolicy` [policies](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/authorization#creating-policies).

Wow! That a lot of code! Indeed, but falter not, you also have control on what to do since the core of this package is simple:

**LARAWIZ GUESSES, DOESN'T IMPOSES**.
