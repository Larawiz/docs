## Scaffold your database like a ðŸ§™ 

If you're looking how a complete scaffold looks, here are the sample files for a `Post` model **with just 7 lines of code!**

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "YAML" id="what-does-scaffold-tab-yaml"
<<< @/docs/samples/yaml.yml{8-15}
:::

::: tab "Model" id="what-does-scaffold-tab-model"
<<< @/docs/samples/model.php
:::

::: tab "Migration" id="what-does-scaffold-tab-tab-migration"
<<< @/docs/samples/migration.php
:::

::: tab "Factory" id="what-does-scaffold-tab-tab-factory"
<<< @/docs/samples/factory.php
:::

::: tab "Seeder" id="what-does-scaffold-tab-tab-seeder"
<<< @/docs/samples/seeder.php
:::

That and much more!
